# JavaScript Works Under the Hood

This folder contains JavaScript files that demonstrate various concepts and features of the language, focusing on advanced topics like currying, arrow functions, hoisting, and asynchronous behavior. Each file includes comments explaining the code and expected outputs, helping you understand and learn from the examples.

## Currying

Currying is a technique for transforming a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions that each take a single argument. The following files demonstrate currying using different syntax and approaches.

### `01-Currying.js`

*Expected Output:*

```
6
```

*Explanation:* This file demonstrates currying by creating a function `curriedMultiply` that takes one argument `a` and returns another function that takes a second argument `b` and returns their product.

*Potential Issue:* If you forget to call the returned function with an argument, the result will be `undefined`.

### `02-Currying02.js`

*Expected Output:*

```
"Hello World"
```

*Explanation:* This file shows how to create a curried function using JavaScript. The `makeGreeting` function takes one string argument and returns another function that takes a second string argument, concatenating them with a space in between.

*Potential Issue:* If you forget to call the returned function with an argument, the output will be `[Function: string]`.

### `03-CurryingwithArrowFunctions.js`

*Expected Output:* No output, as the function is not called.

*Explanation:* This file showcases how to rewrite a curried function using arrow function syntax in JavaScript. The `changeColor` function is refactored to use arrow functions and assigned to the `changeColorArrow` variable.

*Potential Issue:* To test the function, create an object and call the returned function with that object as an argument.

### `04-CurryinginContext.js`

*Expected Output:*

```javascript
[
  { age: 11, sport: 'handball', city: 'San Francisco', dateJoined: 2020-08-21T00:00:00.000Z },
  { age: 4, sport: 'handball', city: 'San Francisco', dateJoined: 2018-03-10T00:00:00.000Z }
]
```

*Explanation:* This file illustrates currying in the context of filtering an array of objects based on multiple criteria. The `filterPlayersByValueFromCity` function takes an array of players, a `city`, a `filterKey`, and a `filterValue` as arguments and returns a new array containing only the players from the specified city who have the specified value for the given key.

*Potential Issue:* If you pass an invalid `filterKey` or `filterValue`, the function will return an empty array.

## Arrow Functions

Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for defining functions in JavaScript. The following file demonstrates the use of arrow functions in the context of currying.

### `03-CurryingwithArrowFunctions.js` (See above)

## Hoisting

Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. The following file demonstrates the concept of hoisting in JavaScript.

### `05-HoistinginJS.js`

*Expected Output:*

```
"Wow, JavaScript is pretty neat."
```

*Explanation:* This file demonstrates the concept of hoisting in JavaScript, where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase.

*Potential Issue:* If you change the order of the function declarations, the output will change.

## Asynchronous Behavior

Asynchronous behavior is a crucial aspect of JavaScript, enabling non-blocking, concurrent execution of code. The following file demonstrates the event loop and asynchronous behavior using promises and `async/await`.

### `06-EventLoopandasynchronous.js`

*Expected Output:*

The order of the first and second `console.log` statements may vary, but the final `console.log` statement will always be last, showcasing the asynchronous nature of JavaScript and the role of the event loop in managing asynchronous operations.

*Explanation:* This file demonstrates the event loop and asynchronous behavior in JavaScript using promises and `async/await`. It contains two functions, `shopForBeans` and `getBeans`, that simulate buying beans and logging messages at different stages of the process.

*Key Takeaways:*

* Promises and `async/await` help manage asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
* The event loop is responsible for executing and managing asynchronous code.
* Asynchronous operations do not block the execution of other code in JavaScript.

## Summary

This folder contains JavaScript files that demonstrate advanced concepts and features of the language, focusing on currying, arrow functions, hoisting, and asynchronous behavior. By working through these examples, you should have a better understanding of how to:

* Use currying to create more flexible and reusable functions.
* Utilize arrow functions for concise and expressive function definitions.
* Leverage hoisting to manage variable and function declarations in JavaScript.
* Work with asynchronous behavior using promises and `async/await` to create efficient and performant code.

## Exercises

Now that you've seen examples of currying in JavaScript, it's time to put your knowledge to the test! Try to solve the following exercises to solidify your understanding of currying.

### Exercise 1: Curried Addition

Write a curried function called `curriedAdd` that takes one argument `a` and returns another function that takes a second argument `b` and returns their sum.

*Example usage:*

```javascript
const addTwo = curriedAdd(2);
console.log(addTwo(3)); // Output: 5
```

### Exercise 2: Curried Multiplication with Initial Value

Create a curried function called `curriedMultiplyWithInit` that takes an initial value `init` and returns another function that takes a multiplier `mult` and returns the product of `init` and `mult`.

*Example usage:*

```javascript
const multiplyByFive = curriedMultiplyWithInit(5);
console.log(multiplyByFive(3)); // Output: 15
```

### Exercise 3: Curried Function with a Fixed Argument

Write a curried function called `curriedFixedArg` that takes a fixed argument `fixed` and returns another function that takes a second argument `arg` and returns the result of applying a specific operation (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) between `fixed` and `arg`.

*Example usage (addition):*

```javascript
const addTen = curriedFixedArg(10)(5);
console.log(addTen); // Output: 15
```

*Example usage (multiplication):*

```javascript
const multiplyByThree = curriedFixedArg(3)(4);
console.log(multiplyByThree); // Output: 12
```
