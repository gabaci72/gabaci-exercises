## File Summaries

### 00-Parent-Child.js

- Demonstrates inheritance by creating a `Parent` class and a `Child` class that extends it.
- Shows how to define properties and methods in the parent class and access them in the child class.
- Example: Creating a `Child` instance and calling a method that logs a greeting.

### 01-IntroToClasses.js

- Introduction to classes in JavaScript.
- Basic class definition, syntax, and structure.
- Example: Creating a `Dog` class with properties and methods.

### 02-Constructor.js

- Understanding constructors in classes.
- Defining and using constructors.
- Example: Creating a `Surgeon` class with a constructor that initializes properties.

### 03-Instance.js

- Creating instances from classes.
- Instantiating objects and accessing properties/methods.
- Example: Creating instances of the `Surgeon` class and accessing their properties.

### 04-Methods.js

- Methods within classes.
- Instance methods, static methods, and method definitions.
- Example: Adding getter methods and instance methods to the `Surgeon` class.

### 05-MethodsCall.js

- Calling methods on class instances.
- Invoking instance methods, static methods, and passing arguments.
- Example: Calling methods on instances of the `Surgeon` class.

### 06-Inheritance1.js

- Inheritance in classes.
- Creating parent and child classes, inheriting properties/methods.
- Example: Creating an `Animal` class and a `Cat` class that inherits from `Animal`.

### 07-Inheritance2.js

- Building upon inheritance concepts.
- Using the `super` keyword, method overriding, accessing parent class methods/properties.
- Example: Demonstrating method overriding and using the `super` keyword.

### 08-Inheritance3.js

- Extending the `HospitalEmployee` class to include specialization and take vacation days.
- Creating a `Nurse` class that inherits from `HospitalEmployee`.
- Example: Creating a `Nurse` instance and demonstrating its properties and methods.

### 09-Inheritance4.js

- Review of inheritance concepts.
- Creating a `Doctor` class that inherits from `HospitalEmployee`.
- Example: Creating a `Doctor` instance and demonstrating its properties and methods.

### 10-Inheritance5.js

- Further review of inheritance concepts.
- Creating a `Person` class with a `sayHello` method and a `Teacher` class that extends it.
- Example: Creating a `Teacher` instance and demonstrating method overriding.

### 11-Static-Methods.js

- Static methods in classes.
- Defining and using static methods, accessing them without creating an instance.
- Example: Creating a `MathUtils` class with static methods for manipulating numbers.

### 12-Class-Review.js

- Review of class-related concepts, including inheritance, methods, and static methods.
- Creating a `Doctor` class that inherits from `HospitalEmployee`.
- Example: Creating a `Doctor` instance and demonstrating its properties and methods.
