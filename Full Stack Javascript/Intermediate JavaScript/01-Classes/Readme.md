## 01-IntroToClasses.js

This file introduces the basic concept of classes in JavaScript. It explains what classes are, why they are useful, and how to define a simple class. The example demonstrates the creation of a `Dog` class with properties and methods.

- **Key Concepts**: Class definition, class syntax, basic class structure.

## 02-Constructor.js

In this file, you will learn about constructors in classes. Constructors are special methods that are called when an instance of a class is created. This file explains how to define and use constructors. The example shows how to create a `Surgeon` class with a constructor that initializes properties.

- **Key Concepts**: Constructor method, `this` keyword, initializing properties.

## 03-Instance.js

This file covers the creation of instances from classes. It explains how to instantiate objects from a class and how to access properties and methods of those instances. The example demonstrates creating instances of the `Surgeon` class and accessing their properties.

- **Key Concepts**: Class instantiation, `new` keyword, accessing instance properties and methods.

## 04-Methods.js

This file delves into methods within classes. It explains different types of methods (instance methods, static methods) and how to define and use them. The example shows how to add getter methods and instance methods to the `Surgeon` class.

- **Key Concepts**: Instance methods, static methods, method definitions.

## 05-MethodsCall.js

In this file, you will see examples of calling methods on class instances. It demonstrates how to invoke instance methods and static methods, and how to pass arguments to methods. The example shows how to call methods on instances of the `Surgeon` class and observe the changes.

- **Key Concepts**: Method invocation, passing arguments, static method calls.
