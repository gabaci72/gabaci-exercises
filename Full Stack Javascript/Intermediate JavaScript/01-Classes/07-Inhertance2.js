/*In the next few exercises, you will create two subclasses (Doctor and Nurse) 
from a parent class named HospitalEmployee. Below, we have listed the properties and methods 
you will find in the Doctor and Nurse classes.

Doctor
Properties: _name, _remainingVacationDays (set to 20 inside the constructor()), _insurance
Methods: .takeVacationDays()

Nurse
Properties: _name, _remainingVacationDays (set to 20 inside constructor()), _certifications
Methods: .takeVacationDays(), .addCertification()
In main.js, create a parent class named HospitalEmployee. Add a constructor with name as an argument.

The Doctor and Nurse classes share two properties: _name and _remainingVacationDays.

Since the _remainingVacationDays is always set to 20, name is the only input parameter. 
Add name between the opening and closing parentheses.*/
class HospitalEmployee {
    constructor(name) {
        this._name = name;
        this._remainingVacationDays = 20;
    }

    get name() {
        return this._name;
    }

    get remainingVacationDays() {
        return this._remainingVacationDays;
    }

    takeVacationDays(daysOff) {
        this._remainingVacationDays -= daysOff;
    }
}

class Doctor extends HospitalEmployee {
    constructor(name, insurance) {
        super(name);
        this._insurance = insurance;
    }

    get insurance() {
        return this._insurance;
    }
}
