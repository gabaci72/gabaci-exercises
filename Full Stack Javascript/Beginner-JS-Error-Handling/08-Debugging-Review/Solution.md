Here are the changes made:

1. Fixed the function declaration syntax by adding a closing parenthesis ) after the parameters.
2. Corrected the variable name from stringLenth to stringLength to ensure it matches the defined variable.
3. Adjusted the conditions to check if the string length is less than minLength and greater than maxLength correctly.
- With these changes, the function should work as intended.
