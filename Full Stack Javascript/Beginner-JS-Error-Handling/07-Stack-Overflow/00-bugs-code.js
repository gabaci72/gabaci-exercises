/* In the code editor, we’ve included an unfinished function, containsCake(). It takes a string and checks if that string contains the substring 'cake' inside of it. If so, it should return true. If not, it should return false.

Using the information in this Stack Overflow post, implement the functionality of this function.

If you’re stuck on how to translate the answer from this forum into working code, check out the hint.

This function is looking to see if a string contains a specific substring. The answers in the Stack Overflow post all use a generic substring. In order to check specifically for "cake" you will need to change any reference to a substring to "cake" in your code. Other than that, any of the answers in the Stack Overflow post should work.*/
