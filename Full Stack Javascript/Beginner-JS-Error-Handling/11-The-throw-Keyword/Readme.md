Creating an error doesn’t cause our program to stop — remember, an error must be thrown for it to halt the program.
The throw keyword is used to throw an error.

If you throw an error, you must handle it with a try/catch block.

A try/catch block is used to handle errors. It marks a block of code to try, and specifies one or more responses should an error occur.

Here is the syntax for a try/catch block:
```javascript 
try {
      Code that may throw an error
 } catch (error) {

      Code to handle the error
 }    
```
The try block contains the code that may throw an error. The catch block contains the code that handles the error.

The code that may throw an error is placed inside the try block. The code to handle the error is placed inside the catch block. The catch block is executed if an error is thrown in the try block.

The error object contains information about the error that was thrown. It has a message property that contains a string describing the error.

Here is an example:

````javascript
 try {
     throw 'Error2';  Generates an exception

 } catch (e) {  Statements to handle any exceptions
     logMyErrors(e);  pass exception object to error handler
 }
 ```
