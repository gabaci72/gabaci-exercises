In main.js, we have a function throwError() that will throw a ReferenceError. There are also two console.log() statements, one at the top of the file and one at the bottom.

Call throwError() below the comment that indicates to call it. Observe what code runs and what code doesn’t.

Make sure you call throwError() before the second console.log() statement. If done correctly, the first console.log() statement will print while the second console.log() statement won’t.

```javascript
console.log('This message will be printed to the console.');

function throwError() {
  // This will throw a ReferenceError
  let notDefinedVar = someUndefinedVariable;
}

// Call throwError() below:
throwError();

console.log('Because of the error, this will not be printed!');
```
By calling throwError() before the second console.log(), the first message will print, but the second message will not, due to the ReferenceError stopping the execution.

```javascript
console.log('This message will be printed to the console.');

function throwError() {
  // Define the variable before using it
  let someUndefinedVariable = "Now I'm defined!";
  let notDefinedVar = someUndefinedVariable;
}

// Call throwError() below:
throwError();

console.log('Because of the error, this will not be printed!');
```
In the corrected code, someUndefinedVariable is defined before it is used, which resolves the ReferenceError.
