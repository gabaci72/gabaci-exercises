# Introduction to Requests with ES6

# JSON Jenerator

## Overview
JSON Jenerator is a simple web application that generates JSON data and displays it on the screen. This project is designed to help users understand how to work with JSON data in a web environment.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following folders and files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the web page.
- `public/`: This folder contains the CSS and JavaScript files.
  - `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the web page.
  - `main.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the generation and display of JSON data using fetch(), async, and await.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Project**:
   Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the application.

2. **Understand the Code in main.js**:
   Click the "Jenerate!" button to see how the code in `main.js` uses `fetch()` and `async/await` to handle requests and display JSON data on the screen.

3. **Study the JSON Response**:
   Take a look at the structure of the response on the web page to see how JSON data is handled.

## Features
- **JSON Generation**: Generates random JSON data.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes.
- **Styling**: Custom styles for a clean and user-friendly interface.
- **Fetch() and Async/Await**: Uses the `fetch()` function and `async/await` syntax to handle requests and process JSON data.

## Technologies Used
