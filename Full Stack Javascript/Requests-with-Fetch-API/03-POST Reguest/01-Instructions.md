# Making a POST Requests Using Fetch API

## Instructions

- [x]  - Task 1:Set the value of the apiKey variable to your Rebrandly API key as a string.

If a correct key is not assigned, proper results will not be seen in the steps afterwards.

- Hint:You can find the apiKey variable declaration at the top of main.js. Replace '<Your API Key>' with your own Rebrandly API key.
-

- [x]  - Task 2: We will make our POST request inside the shortenUrl() function. Inside the code block of shortenUrl(), create a const variable named urlToShorten and assign it inputField.value. urlToShorten will keep the value of what is being typed into the input field.

Note that we will be working inside shortenUrl() for the remainder of this exercise.

- Hint:Make sure youâ€™re working inside the shortenUrl() function.

- [x]  - Task 3: Underneath the urlToShorten declaration, create another const variable named data and assign it to the stringified version of {destination: urlToShorten}. We can use the JSON.stringify() method to do this.

The data variable will be used to send the information, which needs to be in string format, to the request body.

- Hint:We can use the JSON.stringify() method to convert a JSON object to a string like below:

```javascript
JSON.stringify({destination: urlToShorten});
```

- [x]  - Task 4: Below our data variable declaration, call the fetch() function. Pass url as its first argument and an empty object as its second argument.

- Hint: The fetch() function would look something like:

```
fetch(url, {})
```
