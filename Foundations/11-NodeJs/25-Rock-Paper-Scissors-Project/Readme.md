# Rock-Paper-Scissors NodeJS Project:
Did you know that the game Rock-Paper-Scissors can be dated back to the Han dynasty (206 BCE - 200 CE)?

Using your knowledge in Node.js, let’s create an online version of Rock-Paper-Scissors where you can play against the HTTP server. Using the http module, we will build a simple HTTP server. We will practice how to route requests based on pathname and request methods. We will also be using other core Node.js components in this project—we will use the fs module to stream HTML files and create an URL object to extract queries from a URL.
