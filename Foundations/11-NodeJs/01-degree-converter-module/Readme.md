# Degree Converter Module

In this project, a small module has been developed to convert between temperature units. The module consists of a function that can convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

## Module Purpose

The purpose of the module is to convert a given temperature value to another unit system. In this way, conversion can be made between temperature values ​​expressed in different unit systems.

## Module Content

The module contains the following files:

* `celsius-to-fahrenheit.js`: This file consists of a function that can convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
* `water-limits.js`: This file is a file used to calculate the values ​​of the freezing and boiling points of water in Fahrenheit.
* `converters.js`: This file contains functions that can convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit and from Fahrenheit to Celsius.

## Usage

To use the module, you can follow the steps below:

1. Run the `celsius-to-fahrenheit.js` file to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

2. Run the `water-limits.js` file to calculate the freezing and boiling points of water in Fahrenheit.

## Example Usage

To run the `celsius-to-fahrenheit.js` file, you can use the following command:
```bash
node celsius-to-fahrenheit.js 25
```
This command will convert 25 Celsius to Fahrenheit.

To run the `water-limits.js` file, you can use the following command:
```bash
node water-limits.js
```
This command will calculate the freezing and boiling points of water in Fahrenheit.
