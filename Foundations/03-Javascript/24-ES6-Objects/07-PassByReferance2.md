Sure! Let's break down the `07-PassByReferance2.js` file step by step and visualize it using a flow diagram. This will help you understand how object reassignment works in JavaScript when passed as an argument to a function.

### Code Explanation

1. **Object Creation**:
   ```javascript
   let spaceship = {
       homePlanet: 'Earth',
       color: 'red'
   };
   ```
   - An object `spaceship` is created with two properties: `homePlanet` (set to 'Earth') and `color` (set to 'red').

2. **Function Definition**:
   ```javascript
   let tryReassignment = obj => {
       obj = {
           identified: false,
           'transport type': 'flying'
       };
       console.log(obj); // Prints {'identified': false, 'transport type': 'flying'}
   };
   ```
   - A function `tryReassignment` is defined that takes an object `obj` as a parameter.
   - Inside the function, `obj` is reassigned to a new object with properties `identified` (set to `false`) and `'transport type'` (set to `'flying'`).
   - The reassigned object is logged to the console.

3. **Function Invocation**:
   ```javascript
   tryReassignment(spaceship); // The attempt at reassignment does not work.
   ```
   - The `tryReassignment` function is called with `spaceship` as the argument.
   - Inside the function, `obj` is reassigned to a new object, but this reassignment does not affect the original `spaceship` object.

4. **Check `spaceship`**:
   ```javascript
   spaceship; // Still returns {homePlanet: 'Earth', color: 'red'}
   ```
   - After the function call, the original `spaceship` object is checked, and it still has its original properties.

5. **Regular Reassignment**:
   ```javascript
   spaceship = {
       identified: false,
       'transport type': 'flying'
   };
   ```
   - The `spaceship` object is reassigned to a new object with properties `identified` (set to `false`) and `'transport type'` (set to `'flying'`).
   - This reassignment works because it directly modifies the `spaceship` variable.

### Flow Diagram

Here's a textual representation of the flow diagram:

```
Start
|
v
Create spaceship object
|-- homePlanet: 'Earth'
|-- color: 'red'
|
v
Define tryReassignment function
|-- Parameter: obj
|-- obj = {identified: false, 'transport type': 'flying'}
|-- console.log(obj)
|
v
Call tryReassignment(spaceship)
|-- obj (reference to spaceship)
|-- obj = {identified: false, 'transport type': 'flying'}
|-- console.log(obj)
|
v
Check spaceship
|-- Still returns {homePlanet: 'Earth', color: 'red'}
|
v
Reassign spaceship
|-- spaceship = {identified: false, 'transport type': 'flying'}
|
v
End
```

### Detailed Steps

1. **Start**:
   - The execution begins.

2. **Create `spaceship` object**:
   - An object `spaceship` is created with properties `homePlanet` and `color`.

3. **Define `tryReassignment` function**:
   - A function `tryReassignment` is defined that takes an object `obj` as a parameter.
   - Inside the function, `obj` is reassigned to a new object with properties `identified` and `'transport type'`.
   - The reassigned object is logged to the console.

4. **Call `tryReassignment(spaceship)`**:
   - The `tryReassignment` function is called with `spaceship` as the argument.
   - Inside the function, `obj` is reassigned to a new object, but this reassignment does not affect the original `spaceship` object because `obj` is a local variable within the function scope.

5. **Check `spaceship`**:
   - The original `spaceship` object is checked, and it still has its original properties.

6. **Reassign `spaceship`**:
   - The `spaceship` object is reassigned to a new object with properties `identified` and `'transport type'`.
   - This reassignment works because it directly modifies the `spaceship` variable.

7. **End**:
   - The execution ends.

### Visualization

If you prefer a visual representation, you can draw the flow diagram as follows:

```
Start
  |
  v
Create spaceship object
  |-- homePlanet: 'Earth'
  |-- color: 'red'
  |
  v
Define tryReassignment function
  |-- Parameter: obj
  |-- obj = {identified: false, 'transport type': 'flying'}
  |-- console.log(obj)
  |
  v
Call tryReassignment(spaceship)
  |-- obj (reference to spaceship)
  |-- obj = {identified: false, 'transport type': 'flying'}
  |-- console.log(obj)
  |
  v
Check spaceship
  |-- Still returns {homePlanet: 'Earth', color: 'red'}
  |
  v
Reassign spaceship
  |-- spaceship = {identified: false, 'transport type': 'flying'}
  |
  v
End
```

This flow diagram should help you understand how object reassignment works in JavaScript when passed as an argument to a function. The key point is that reassignment within the function does not affect the original object because the parameter is a local variable within the function scope.
