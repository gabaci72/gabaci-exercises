Sure! Let's break down the `08-PassByReferance3.js` file step by step and visualize it using a flow diagram. This will help you understand how the object is modified when passed as an argument to multiple functions.

### Code Explanation

1. **Object Creation**:
   ```javascript
   let spaceship = {
       'Fuel Type': 'Turbo Fuel',
       homePlanet: 'Earth'
   };
   ```
   - An object `spaceship` is created with two properties: `'Fuel Type'` (set to `'Turbo Fuel'`) and `homePlanet` (set to `'Earth'`).

2. **Function Definitions**:
   ```javascript
   let greenEnergy = obj => {
       obj['Fuel Type'] = 'avocado oil';
   };

   let remotelyDisable = obj => {
       obj.disabled = true;
   };
   ```
   - Two functions, `greenEnergy` and `remotelyDisable`, are defined. Both take an object `obj` as a parameter.
   - `greenEnergy` changes the `'Fuel Type'` property of `obj` to `'avocado oil'`.
   - `remotelyDisable` adds a `disabled` property to `obj` and sets it to `true`.

3. **Function Invocations**:
   ```javascript
   greenEnergy(spaceship);
   remotelyDisable(spaceship);
   ```
   - The `greenEnergy` function is called with `spaceship` as the argument.
   - The `remotelyDisable` function is called with `spaceship` as the argument.
   - Both functions modify the original `spaceship` object because objects are passed by reference.

4. **Log the `spaceship` Object**:
   ```javascript
   console.log(spaceship);
   ```
   - The modified `spaceship` object is logged to the console to confirm the changes.

### Flow Diagram

Here's a textual representation of the flow diagram:

```
Start
|
v
Create spaceship object
|-- 'Fuel Type': 'Turbo Fuel'
|-- homePlanet: 'Earth'
|
v
Define greenEnergy function
|-- Parameter: obj
|-- obj['Fuel Type'] = 'avocado oil'
|
v
Define remotelyDisable function
|-- Parameter: obj
|-- obj.disabled = true
|
v
Call greenEnergy(spaceship)
|-- obj (reference to spaceship)
|-- obj['Fuel Type'] = 'avocado oil'
|
v
Call remotelyDisable(spaceship)
|-- obj (reference to spaceship)
|-- obj.disabled = true
|
v
Log spaceship object
|-- { 'Fuel Type': 'avocado oil', homePlanet: 'Earth', disabled: true }
|
v
End
```

### Detailed Steps

1. **Start**:
   - The execution begins.

2. **Create `spaceship` object**:
   - An object `spaceship` is created with properties `'Fuel Type'` and `homePlanet`.

3. **Define `greenEnergy` function**:
   - A function `greenEnergy` is defined that takes an object `obj` as a parameter.
   - Inside the function, the `'Fuel Type'` property of `obj` is set to `'avocado oil'`.

4. **Define `remotelyDisable` function**:
   - A function `remotelyDisable` is defined that takes an object `obj` as a parameter.
   - Inside the function, a `disabled` property is added to `obj` and set to `true`.

5. **Call `greenEnergy(spaceship)`**:
   - The `greenEnergy` function is called with `spaceship` as the argument.
   - Inside the function, the `'Fuel Type'` property of `spaceship` is changed to `'avocado oil'`.

6. **Call `remotelyDisable(spaceship)`**:
   - The `remotelyDisable` function is called with `spaceship` as the argument.
   - Inside the function, a `disabled` property is added to `spaceship` and set to `true`.

7. **Log `spaceship` object**:
   - The modified `spaceship` object is logged to the console.
   - The output will be: `{ 'Fuel Type': 'avocado oil', homePlanet: 'Earth', disabled: true }`.

8. **End**:
   - The execution ends.

### Visualization

If you prefer a visual representation, you can draw the flow diagram as follows:

```
Start
  |
  v
Create spaceship object
  |-- 'Fuel Type': 'Turbo Fuel'
  |-- homePlanet: 'Earth'
  |
  v
Define greenEnergy function
  |-- Parameter: obj
  |-- obj['Fuel Type'] = 'avocado oil'
  |
  v
Define remotelyDisable function
  |-- Parameter: obj
  |-- obj.disabled = true
  |
  v
Call greenEnergy(spaceship)
  |-- obj (reference to spaceship)
  |-- obj['Fuel Type'] = 'avocado oil'
  |
  v
Call remotelyDisable(spaceship)
  |-- obj (reference to spaceship)
  |-- obj.disabled = true
  |
  v
Log spaceship object
  |-- { 'Fuel Type': 'avocado oil', homePlanet: 'Earth', disabled: true }
  |
  v
End
```

This flow diagram should help you understand how the `spaceship` object is modified when passed as an argument to multiple functions. The key point is that both functions modify the original `spaceship` object because objects are passed by reference.
