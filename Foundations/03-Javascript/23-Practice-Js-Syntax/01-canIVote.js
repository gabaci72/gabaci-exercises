/* The most common minimum age to vote is 18. 
Write a function canIVote() that takes in a number, 
representing the personâ€™s age, and returns the boolean true 
if they are 18 years old or older, and the boolean false if they are not.*/

// Write your function here:

function canIVote(age) {
    return age >= 18;
}





// Uncomment the line below when you're ready to try out your function
console.log(canIVote(19)) // Should print true

// We encourage you to add more function calls of your own to test your code!
