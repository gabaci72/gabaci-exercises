# JavaScript Learning Journey ðŸš€More specifically, I have learned to:

- implement JavaScript data types, built-in methods, and variables
- use conditionals to control the flow of a program in JavaScript
- construct functions and pass data through them
- identify global and block-level scopes in JavaScript
- use arrays to store lists of data
- use loops to execute blocks of code multiple times
- use iterator methods to simplify the process of looping over arrays
- use JavaScript ES6 object syntax to model real-world items.
