//Array Operations: Push, Pop, Includes, Length
//Write a JavaScript program that performs the following operations on an array:
//1. Push a new element to the end of the array.
//Pop an element from the end of the array.
//Check if the array includes a specific element.
//Get the length of the array.

//Example:
const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];
fruits.push('grape');
fruits.pop();
console.log(fruits.includes('banana'));
console.log(fruits.length);
