/*1.Now, make your own! Create a program that loops from 5 to 10 and logs each number to the console.

When writing/changing loops, there is a chance that our stopping condition isnâ€™t met and we get a dreaded infinite loop which essentially stops our programming from running anything else! To exit out of an infinite loop in an exercise, refresh the page - then fix the code for your loop. */
