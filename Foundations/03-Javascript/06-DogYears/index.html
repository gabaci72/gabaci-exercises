    <p>Dogs mature at a faster rate than human beings. 
        We often say a dog’s age can be calculated in “dog years” to 
        account for their growth compared to a human of the same age. 
        In some ways we could say, time moves quickly for dogs — 8 years in a human’s 
        life equates to 45 years in a dog’s life. How old would you be if you were a dog?
        
        Here’s how you convert your age from “human years” to “dog years”:
        
        The first two years of a dog’s life count as 10.5 dog years each.
        Each year following equates to 4 dog years.
        Before you start doing the math in your head, 
        let a computer take care of it! With your knowledge 
        of math operators and variables, use JavaScript to 
        convert your human age into dog years.

<p>Later Years in Dog Years: <span id="laterYears"></span></p>

<script>
    // Declare a constant variable for my age
    const myAge = 25; // Replace 25 with your actual age

    // Initialize a variable for the first two years of a dog's life
    let earlyYears = 2;

    // Use the multiplication assignment operator to multiply the value saved to earlyYears by 10.5 and reassign it to earlyYears
    earlyYears *= 10.5;

    // Calculate the later years by subtracting the first two years from my age
    let laterYears = myAge - 2;

    // Multiply the later years by 4 to convert to dog years
    laterYears *= 4;

    // Display earlyYears and laterYears in HTML
    document.getElementById("earlyYears").textContent = earlyYears;
    document.getElementById("laterYears").textContent = laterYears;
